# Get-Outdoors-WebApp
With this application I want to display a page that prompts a user to 
pick a state that they would be interested in hunting whitetail deer in.

Depending on the state they choose I want the link to take them to a page
that displays an image of the state record buck (if available) and give them
bullet points on deer population density, price tags for hunting that state,
game laws for the state, and an overall rating for hunting in that state with 
the county that has the most reported deer harvests.

With this app I could eventually add in all game animals to the web page,
but as a final project I intend to just keep it with whitetail deer.
